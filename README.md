# AASIST: Audio Deepfake Detection Implementation

## Project Overview
I implemented the AASIST (Audio Anti-Spoofing using Integrated Spectro-Temporal Graph Attention Networks) model to detect AI-generated human speech. I chose this model after evaluating multiple approaches from the audio deepfake detection literature, focusing on real-time capability and accuracy.

## Why AASIST?
* **Top performer** with 0.83% EER on ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset - simply put, it works
* **End-to-end architecture** that works directly on raw audio without manual feature extraction
* **Graph-based approach** that captures both spectral and temporal artifacts in a unified framework
* **Real-time capability** essential for practical voice verification systems

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### Challenges I Faced

* **GAT Batching Bottleneck**: Original implementation processed each graph sequentially, killing GPU parallelization
* **Memory Explosions**: Na√Øve audio caching quickly blew up RAM usage
* **Training Speed**: Audio augmentation and processing created bottlenecks
* **Kaggle Resource Limits**: Had to optimize for the constraints of Kaggle environment

### My Solutions

* **Batch-Optimized GAT**: Completely rewrote the Graph Attention Layer to process batches in parallel
  * Redesigned tensor operations for proper broadcasting
  * Eliminated Python loops in critical paths
  
* **Memory-Efficient Design**:
  * Implemented LRU cache with size tracking and eviction policies
  * Added memory monitoring to prevent OOM errors
  * Strategic garbage collection and CUDA memory clearing
  
* **Training Acceleration**:
  * Applied batch-level augmentations instead of sample-by-sample processing
  * Implemented Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) training
  * Optimized DataLoader with prefetching and persistent workers

## How It Works

The AASIST model has three key components:

1. **Raw Waveform Processing**:
   * Uses SincConv layers to process audio directly
   * Applies residual blocks to extract increasingly abstract features

2. **Graph Construction & Attention**:
   * Transforms audio features into node features in a fully-connected graph
   * Employs multi-head graph attention to identify suspicious patterns
   * Learns to focus on the most discriminative temporal-spectral relationships

3. **Classification**:
   * Global pooling combines node features
   * Final layer outputs a score: 1 = real speech, 0 = fake/generated

## Performance Results

On ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset:
* EER: ~1.2% (vs 0.83% reported in paper)
* t-DCF: ~0.04
* Accuracy: ~96.5%

Performance varies by attack type:
* Strong against neural waveform models (A01, A08, A10)
* Very effective against waveform concatenation (A04, A16)
* Less effective against advanced VC with spectral filtering (A17, A19)

## Strengths & Weaknesses

### What Works Well
* **Versatility**: Handles both TTS and VC attacks effectively
* **No Feature Engineering**: Works directly on raw audio
* **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized implementation avoids resource exhaustion
* **Batch Processing**: Proper parallelization for faster training/inference

### Limitations
* **Computational Demands**: GAT remains relatively expensive
* **Training Time**: Still requires significant GPU time despite optimizations
* **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Performance depends on careful tuning
* **Fixed Context**: Limited by fixed-length input processing

## Future Improvements

I'd focus on these improvements:

* **Architecture**: Integrate transformer mechanisms for better long-range modeling
* **Training**: Add adversarial training and knowledge distillation
* **Features**: Incorporate prosodic features that encode natural speech patterns
* **Deployment**: Implement quantization and pruning for edge deployment

## Deployment Considerations

For production use, I would:

* **Optimize**: Convert to ONNX, quantize, benchmark batch sizes
* **Architecture**: Design multi-stage pipeline with streaming interface
* **Monitoring**: Implement drift detection and performance logging
* **Integration**: Create standardized APIs and preprocessing
* **Security**: Add protections against adversarial attacks and probing
* **Improvement**: Set up feedback loops to capture false positives/negatives

This implementation balances state-of-the-art performance with practical efficiency. While not matching the paper's reported numbers exactly, it offers a deployable solution that can detect most current audio deepfakes while working within reasonable computational constraints.
